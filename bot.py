`/queue [clear/view]` prints or clears the queue.
`/resume` resumes playing song.

`/stop` stops playing and leaves the vc.\n
`!sing` sends the lyrics of the song you enter one-by-one. use carefully, or you might get banned :D
`!shout` SHOUTS the lyrics of the song you enter one-by-one. use carefully, or you might get banned :D
`!stop` stops sending lyrics.
`!time` adjusts the time between each line\n
