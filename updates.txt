Added `!aarush`, which randomly pings an aarush from the server.
Added `/skip`, which enables skipping a currently playing a song.
Added `/bradley_hate` which allows mods and my creator to disable or enable the Bradley-hating features. They will be disabled by default from now on :(
Added `/8ball' which replicates the peak logical prowess of a UGA student to help you make decisions.

Added a placeholder function for `\meme`. in the future, this command will allow you to generate your own memes!
